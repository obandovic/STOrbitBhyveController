# STOrbitBhyveController Proxy Node
#### * SmartThings® Integration for the b•hyve™ hose faucet timers *
### Alpha Testing Version: 0.0.3

---

## Description:
### This alpha proxy node server provides: 
1. Support for controlling 'open' or 'closed' Bhyve states from SmartThings.   
2. Pushover Messaging Integration
3. Builds upon the base code for interfacing SmartThings and b•hyve™ with a Node.js/MQTT/Websocket server for real-time response.
4. Auto Flow Sensor after a watering notification event which will report more detailed flow rate and total gallons to ST.

## Requirements:

1. Lots of patience and consideration for this very rough alpha release that will require several more hours/days/weeks of debugging and re-testing.  *I am not a Javascript/Node developer by nature, but I feel this language/platform is optimal for creating the asynchronous Websocket connection and API integration with SmartThings.  Minimal support will be provided for this distribution.*
2. A **'Node.js'** compatible server on local lan
	* (e.g. Raspberry Pi Server, etc)
		* Model 3 or higher for performance 
		* Debian Version Stretch or Buster
3. Advanced knowledge of Linux commands and system, Node, NPM, Javascript, File Editing, MQTT, etc
4. SmartThings hub
	* Orbit Bhyve Controller SmartApp Installed [Version 4+](https://github.com/KurtSanders/STOrbitBhyveController)
5. Text file editor of your choice (e.g. Nano, etc)


## Installation & Configuration

### **Instructions**

### Orbit Bhyve Controller SmartApp

1. Enable the Orbit Bhyve Controller SmartApp API Setup and obtain the API strings displayed from the ST IDE Live Logging view of Orbit Bhyve Controller SmartApp  ([See 'ST IDE Live Logging View' below for details](https://github.com/KurtSanders/STOrbitBhyveController/tree/master/node#st-ide-live-logging-view))
2. Enter the local IP address of the proxy server and webserver port as required

</p>

### ST IDE Live Logging View

1. When one enters and exist the API Setup section in the Orbit bhyve SmartApp (see above), the SmartThings API and Secret strings will be displayed in the Live Logging view.  This allows one to copy and paste these two strings into the Raspberry Pi's .env file.

### Node.js Server

> These generic instructions are for a Raspberry Pi proxy server running Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian. Please modify these commands as needed for alternate servers and O/S's as needed.

_It is highly recommended to make a backup of your server in case you want to return to the state before this install_

1. Install Node.js and npm *(If not already installed)*

	```
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
	nodejs --version
	npm --version
	```

2. Install and verify the mosquitto MQTT Broker is active *(If not already installed)*

	```
 	sudo apt install mosquitto 	
 	sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
 	sudo systemctl start mosquitto
 	```
 	
 	`sudo systemctl status mosquitto`	

	> 
	> ● mosquitto.service - Mosquitto MQTT Broker<br>
	> Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mosquitto.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)<br>
	> Active: active (running)<br>
	>  Docs: man:mosquitto.conf(5)<br>
	>        man:mosquitto(8)<br>
	> Main PID: 13905 (mosquitto)<br>
	> Tasks: 1 (limit: 4915)<br>
	> Memory: 924.0K<br>
	> CGroup: /system.slice/mosquitto.service<br>
	>        └─13905 /usr/sbin/mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf<br>
	> 	<br>
	> systemd[1]: Starting Mosquitto MQTT Broker...<br>
	> systemd[1]: Started Mosquitto MQTT Broker.<br>
 
3. Create a new folder named 'bhyve' to house the bhyve node.js application files.

	`mkdir bhyve`

4. Change to that directory to make it current.

	`cd bhyve`

5. Download the 'st-orbit-bhyve-controller-x.x.x.tgz' where x.x.x below is the [current version of this file](https://github.com/KurtSanders/STOrbitBhyveController/tree/master/node) to the server's 'bhyve' folder with the wget command below:

	`wget https://github.com/KurtSanders/STOrbitBhyveController/raw/master/node/st-orbit-bhyve-controller-x.x.x.tgz`
	
6. Unpack the downloaded tarball where x.x.x is the [current version](https://github.com/KurtSanders/STOrbitBhyveController/tree/master/node) into the 'bhyve' folder and list the files

	```
	tar -xvf st-orbit-bhyve-controller-x.x.x.tgz --strip-components 1
	```

7. Install st-orbit-bhyve-controller required node modules

	`npm install`

8. Configure Environment .env File

	* Copy the .env-sample template file to .env and edit the .env file to add the required information according to the table below:

	`cp .env-sample .env`
	
	`nano .env`

12. After confirming no errors and that you can turn on/off your watering devices from SmartThings Tile, press Ctrl-C to end the process.

13. Run the node application as a detached process in the background:

	- Option 1 (No additional software but limited restart and logging capabilities)
	
		`node app.js &`

	- Option 2 Monitoring & Restart Capabilities (**Preferred**)
	
		* Install [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/#installation)
		
		> PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.
		
		```
		sudo npm install pm2 -g
		pm2 startup
			* Follow instructions and execute the command as displayed
		* nano ecosystem.config.js
			* Edit and verify/change the 'args' string to reflect the correct directory path
			* Save the file
